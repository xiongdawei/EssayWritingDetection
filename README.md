# EssayWritingDetection

## Background
One problem among the WeChat groups affiliated with universities recently face is the frequent appearance of ad bots spamming the group chat. These ad bots are typically advertising about "essay and homework services", which is illegal and annoying. A typical ad bot will enter new group chats by scanning the QR code invitations from other group chats, and hybernate for approximately 2 days to several weeks before sending out the ad. We created this project to better identify and remove these ad bots from the chat so less people would suffer from these ad bots.\
